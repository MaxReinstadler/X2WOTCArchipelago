# XCOM 2 War of the Chosen

## What are locations and items in this game?

### Locations

- Completion of research and shadow projects
- First kill on each enemy type

### Items

- Research/shadow project unlocks (including story progress)
- Resources such as supplies, intel, elerium cores, etc.
- Weapon upgrades

## What do location checks and items look like in this game?

When reaching a location in the strategic layer, a pop-up appears to inform the player about the item they found
and who it belongs to. No such pop-up will currently appear in the tactical layer.

Items are currently only received in the geoscape, including any the player sent to themself. When the game receives an item,
a pop-up appears to inform the player about what they got and from whom.

## How was this game adapted to fit into Archipelago?

Various features have been added to reduce the length of a campaign, such as missions being skipped and soldiers gaining more XP passively.
Additionally, the final mission can be unlocked via three different routes (previously requiring the completion of all three).
Expect the game to be comfortably beatable in roughly 15 to 20 hours on default settings.

## What if I want to play a vanilla campaign?

Download [Mod Config Menu for WotC](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300) and navigate to
`Settings > Mod Settings > WOTCArchipelago`. Turn off all settings under "Reduced Campaign Duration" (also set sliders to 0).
Turn on all settings under "Campaign Completion Requirements" (NOTE: you will also need to set the corresponding
option correctly in your yaml for generation).
