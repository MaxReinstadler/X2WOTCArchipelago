2. Download the latest release of the [XCOM 2 WotC APWorld](https://github.com/MaxReinstadler/X2WOTCArchipelago/releases). Double-click it to install automatically, or copy it to your Archipelago installation's `custom_worlds` folder manually.
3. **(Optional)** Download the latest release of the [Universal Tracker APWorld](https://github.com/MaxReinstadler/X2WOTCArchipelago/releases). Double-click it to install automatically, or copy it to your Archipelago installation's `custom_worlds` folder manually.

## Generating a Multiworld

1. Follow the general [Archipelago Guide](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) for generating and hosting a Multiworld.
    - Multiworld will have to be generated locally but can be hosted on the website.
    - [APWorld](https://github.com/MaxReinstadler/X2WOTCArchipelago/releases) can be found on GitHub.
    - [Options Template](https://github.com/MaxReinstadler/X2WOTCArchipelago/releases) can be generated with the 'Generate Template Options' button in the Archipelago Launcher, or found on GitHub.

## Joining a Multiworld

0. Upon launching the XCOM 2 WotC AP Client, the proxy server will be hosted locally (at port 24728 by default).
    - If this doesn't work for you for whatever reason, the port can be changed using the `/proxy` client command.
1. In the client, connect to the address the Multiworld is hosted at.
2. Provide your slot name (the name you entered into your YAML).
3. If asked, provide the room password that was set during generation.
4. The client will tell you that you're connected. Start playing!
    - **NOTE:** You must connect to the server before you launch the game. If the game was already running, restart it.
